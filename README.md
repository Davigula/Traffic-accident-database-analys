"# Traffic-accident-database-analysis" 

- Analyzed key demographic and traffic data, including gender, age, seat belt use, type of
crash, and airbag deployment in the R programming language
- Conducted statistical tests to identify patterns and draw conclusions about risky traffic behavior,
with an emphasis on differences between males and females
- Found that men are more likely to be involved in traffic accidents, are more prone to head-on collisions, and are more likely to die in
accidents, while women are more likely to use seat belts
- Analysis showed that airbag deployment is significantly associated with crash survival, confirming
initial assumptions
- Demonstrated skills in data processing, analyzing large datasets, and drawing conclusions applicable to
the entire population
